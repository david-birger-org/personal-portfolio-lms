This was one of the key factors behind my decision to move into strength sports."

My first gym training sessions (which I began in 2013) were at the Halla fitness club under one of Lviv’s most experienced coaches, Viktor Yarullin. Thanks to his coaching skill and extensive experience, the essential technical and strength foundations were built. I learned to understand my body, recover correctly, and progress load properly. In essence, my first years were powerlifting-oriented, building a strength base (which I still maintain). At the same time, I gained muscle mass as a side effect of strength development. In that same gym, I gained my first coaching experience, working for one year from 2017 to 2018."

Posing in bodybuilding is the component where I want to become better. A free routine and musical accompaniment help develop bodybuilding not only as a sport, but as an art form. People want to watch those they aspire to resemble. In my view, attending a bodybuilding event should feel like going to the theater. People should enjoy a performance - a spectacular show."

This is the vision I follow and promote among young people and the broader public. In 2017, I actively began building my Instagram profile and sharing my view of sport and natural bodybuilding. In my opinion, every athlete who chooses natural bodybuilding should have the opportunity to compete among natural athletes. That is exactly why I moved in this direction. I began following the best natural athletes in the world and noticed that they competed in WNBF - the most authoritative federation. I set a goal: one day Ukraine would have its own natural bodybuilding federation. In my posts and videos, I tagged WNBF, and eventually it was noticed. WNBF President Bob Bell wrote to me. After an exceptionally productive conversation, a decision was made to create the first natural bodybuilding federation in Ukraine - the official WNBF Ukraine representation. This is truly a historic event for our country. It is a great honor for me to serve as president of this federation. Since its founding in 2021, my team and I have done everything possible to develop natural bodybuilding and provide a platform for doping control for athletes from around the world."

Millions of Ukrainians faced the brutal realities of war. Sport moved to second place, because national security and defense always come first. It was a time when I had to decide the future of Ukrainian natural bodybuilding: either we pause activity during active war, or we continue to work despite everything. I am an optimist by nature, so we made a decision I will be proud of for life. We began preparing the second international tournament, held on November 5, 2022 in Lviv. That tournament had two times fewer athletes, but it did not demotivate me in any way - it gave me even more drive to develop this direction. By the way, an athlete from Israel came and became absolute champion in Men’s Physique."

Since the war began, we could not rely on foreign athletes due to safety and logistics constraints (flight restrictions). This directly affected the strategy I built for federation development. We decided to organize camps in different Ukrainian cities for education, seminars, and broader involvement of Ukrainian athletes in competitive sport. As a result, our third tournament was much more successful."

              "text": "In that same year, I made my international WNBF debut. On October 28, 2023, Warsaw hosted the first natural bodybuilding tournament in Poland’s history, where I earned a WNBF Pro card in Bodybuilding. These competitions are special to me: they were my first in WNBF, my first abroad, and my first where I won gold in this federation. It was also the first tournament of the official WNBF Poland representation, led by Mariusz Czernewicz (now my coach). So these competitions are truly special to me. That season, I traveled with my mother, Nataliia Terekhova (I wrote about her achievements later), and for her it was also a first international experience: silver in a very challenging class. Then we headed to Germany, to Wolfratshausen (near Munich), where two tournaments were held in one day: one for amateurs (without a WNBF Pro card) and one for professionals. I already competed among pro athletes and managed to enter TOP-4 (an excellent result for a first attempt). My mother took two gold medals in her categories, finishing her season very successfully. Then came the most important start of my life... We returned to Poland and stayed in Krakow, from where I was to fly overseas. Just two weeks later, on November 19, 2023, I competed at the Natural Bodybuilding World Championship in Seattle, USA, and became Vice World Champion in Bodybuilding. The trip to the United States gave me a new push for growth in every area. That country allowed me to believe in myself in a way I never had before. There, every skill and talent feels like it gets 10x acceleration (at least that is how I felt). For me, America represents that very dream we can imagine and also build here - in Ukraine."

The number of Ukrainian athletes increased by 50%."

It began in 2019, when I performed to a melody titled “Neptune,” and in 2020 I had a photoshoot in Lviv’s Rynok Square near the fountain of the same name. I thought long and hard about the title, and my mother, Nataliia Terekhova, suggested adding “Path” to “Neptune.” I am deeply grateful to my mother for her upbringing, life advice, and colossal influence on my development as a person. She is an example of loyalty, devotion to moral principles, and extraordinary thirst for life. Her optimism and positivity always inspire me in the toughest moments. When things are difficult, I know I can receive wise and inspiring advice from her. She is a fantastic person - very kind, always ready to help at any moment. I hope she one day tells her life story in a book - believe me, it would be a bestseller."

As Albert Einstein said: “Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere,” and also, “Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the whole world, stimulating progress and giving birth to evolution.”"

On that morning, one of the most massive attacks occurred, and I wanted to cancel the event. But I know what it means to be an athlete preparing for competition: months of exhausting contest prep, daily training, and living a dream (I saw myself in their place). So we made the decision to move forward as planned. Looking back, I understand this is another decision I will be incredibly proud of, just like the one made at the beginning of 2022. The tournament was extraordinary: exclusive sponsor awards - handcrafted crowns from Family Gold Masters for women’s category champions, golden tridents from Kuznia Lviv, and our medals for all athletes decorated with water and ocean symbolism. I also sincerely thank the Mega Mass sports nutrition chain, which has supported natural bodybuilding development since our foundation in 2021. Most of all, I am proud of Ukrainian athletes - you truly deserve the highest honors, because despite every obstacle, you continue to show devotion to this sport, moving with discipline along your own Path and building a legacy that will inspire future generations."

I combine all of this with work - personal coaching, online athletes, federation leadership (including marketing, management, accounting, legal work, strategic planning, communication with other international WNBF representatives and athletes, logistics, judging, camp and seminar organization, design, sponsor and partner relations, SMM and social media, video production, the WNBF Ukraine YouTube podcast “Natural Sport,” competition production, and many other responsibilities). This is what I love and what I will keep doing, because I have both inspiration and a clear vision for developing natural bodybuilding."

I traveled with my mother, who competes in the Figure and Fitbody women’s categories - she is the most titled athlete from Ukraine in our federation. Our journey began in Poland, where we set up training camp before the key start in the USA. Our flight was scheduled for October 28, and on that very day we were already overseas. New York welcomed us vividly - a city remembered for life through its diversity and character. Two days before the tournament, we successfully passed polygraph testing and received official approval to compete at Naturalmania. On the morning of November 1, we headed to White Plains, a New York suburb, for the event. After applying tan for the second time (the first layer was done a day before), we finally felt we were truly there and ready to deliver 100%. And that is exactly what happened: my mother won gold in Figure Open and Figure Masters, and I became overall champion in Classic Physique (a new WNBF category focused first of all on aesthetic structure, balanced proportions, and posing). I took first in my height class and then defeated the champion of the other (taller) class (it was very difficult, and I was surprised by this success). That day, I also earned a WNBF Pro card - now in Classic Physique (two years earlier, I became a pro in Bodybuilding)."

Of course, we could not have expected this level of success before the trip, and winning two tournaments gave us the confidence needed ahead of the most prestigious event in world natural bodybuilding."

On Saturday, November 22, my mother competed - she debuted in a new category for herself, Fit Body, and won bronze. I competed the next day and once again became Vice World Champion - this time in Classic Physique. Full understanding of everything we experienced will come later (I am writing this after two months have already passed, and I still cannot fully believe it). The 2025 season was intense. Next comes preparation for the next season - we need to improve proportions and priority muscle groups. The decisive factor in progress is TIME, and everyone who chooses the path of natural bodybuilding should understand that."
